- a page with a form for adding new words
- a page with a check, if the user has added more than 10 words to the vocabulary, then on this page user can take a test and check his knowledge
- a page with a history of checks, where all statements and their results, which the user passed, are saved. On this page, the user can immediately see which words he has already learned, and where he made a mistake and needs to spend more time studying them.
